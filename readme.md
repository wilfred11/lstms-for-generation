In repo I describe my ventures into the world of Gen-AI. In this project I am trying to create an oldskool text generator, using torch and LSTMs. In the accompanying [report](https://github.com/wilfred11/lstms-for-generation/blob/main/wvc-gen-ai-opdracht-3.pdf) a very complete insight is given on the things happening inside the notebooks.
